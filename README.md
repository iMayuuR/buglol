## 💻 Platform Support

| Platform | Audio Engine | Setup Required? |
|---|---|---|
| 🪟 **Windows** (XP / 7 / 10 / 11) | `wscript.exe` + Windows Media Player | ✅ None |
| 🍎 **macOS** (From ancient Leopard to latest Sequoia 15+) | `afplay` (built-in) | ✅ None |
| 🐧 **Linux** | `mpg123` / `ffplay` / `paplay` | ⚠️ See below |

### 🐧 Linux Audio Setup

BugLOL tries the following audio players in order. Install at least one:

**Option 1 — mpg123** (recommended, lightest):
```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install mpg123

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install mpg123

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S mpg123
```

**Option 2 — ffplay** (if you already have ffmpeg):
```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Fedora
sudo dnf install ffmpeg

# Arch
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

**Option 3 — paplay** (PulseAudio — usually pre-installed on Ubuntu/GNOME):
```bash
# Typically already available — check with:
which paplay
```

> 💡 **Tip:** After installing, reload your editor once (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Developer: Reload Window`).

## 🚫🔊 Troubleshooting — No Sound?

**1. No sound file selected yet**
- Click the **BugLOL** button (bottom status bar) → search and select a sound first.

**2. Sound file not downloaded**
- Select a sound again from the BugLOL panel — it will re-download automatically.

**3. Windows — Windows Media Player disabled**
- Open `Optional Features` in Windows Settings → enable **Windows Media Player**.

**4. Linux — no audio player installed**
- Run `sudo apt install mpg123` (or see Linux setup above).

**5. No errors in the Problems panel**
- BugLOL triggers on **diagnostics errors** (red underlines), not warnings. Make sure actual errors exist.

**6. Extension not activating**
- Open Command Palette → `Developer: Show Extension Host Log` → check for `[BugLOL]` entries.
- Try reloading: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Developer: Reload Window`.
